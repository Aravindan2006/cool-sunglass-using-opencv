# Sturdy-Octo-Disco-Adding-Sunglasses-for-a-Cool-New-Look

Welcome to Sturdy Octo Disco! This is a small project I created to overlay sunglasses on passport photos using image processing. The idea was to make a normal photo look cooler and learn some basics of computer vision at the same time. Through this project, I got to explore how to detect faces and place an object (sunglasses) exactly where it should go. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice Python and OpenCV, and it turns boring photos into something quirky and interesting!

## Features:
- Detects the face in an image.
- Places a stylish sunglass overlay perfectly on the face.
- Works seamlessly with individual passport-size photos.
- Customizable for different sunglasses styles or photo types.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV for image processing
- Numpy for array manipulations

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Add your passport-sized photo to the `images` folder.
3. Run the script to see your "cool" transformation!

## Applications:
- Learning basic image processing techniques.
- Adding flair to your photos for fun.
- Practicing computer vision workflows.

Feel free to fork, contribute, or customize this project for your creative needs!
